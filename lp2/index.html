                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The overview for learning plan 2 was demonstrating many CSS properties and going more in depth with new CSS3 properties focused on design and text fonts.  </p><br/>
                    <h2>Goals of the assignment</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this assignment was to use built-in HTML tags instead of using a custom stylesheet to create them. This assignment had me do many practices on all CSS styles/properties and had tests at the end of them.I learned many new CSS properties and was able to implement them onto my project to show what I learned.</p>

                        <p>This project had me employ and use many CSS properties to modify my page. Some examples here being back-ground properties, to hoverable pagination, to CSS type effects, etc.</p>
                        <p>I learned many new properties and how to style my pages better. Some new things I learned were color opacity, all types of ordered lists, and many more. </p>
