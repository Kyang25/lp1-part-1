                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The overview of lesson 5 was learning CSS transitions.</p><br/>
                <h2>Goals of the assignment</h2>
                <p>The goal of this assignment was to implement many transitions into our sites. This could be from implementing properties such as the many different transition properties. Examples being, transition-timing-property or transition-duration, etc. </p>
                <p>I learned how to use best practices to use them in my practice. The examples I did help me further understand how transitions work.</p><br/>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Overall I didn't know much about transitions and don't think I ever used them before. The assessment was alright and I'd say I had an alright time doing this, not too hard and not simple either.</p>

                    <p>This assignment first had me document practices that were apart of w3schools. I found the practices to be very helpful for me and I found it to be understandable. </p><br/>

                    <p>This practice has the many transitions.</p>
