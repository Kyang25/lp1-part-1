             <h1>About learning plan 4</h1> <br/>
               <h2>Overview</h2>
               <p>For learning plan 4 we had to learn about RWD (responsive web design) how it works, what's it used for and why we use it.</p><br/>
               <h2>Goals of the assignment</h2>
                <p>The goal of this assignment was implementing this into our practices to show the different sizes for mobile design, laptop, and desktop. We had to add breakpoints and show the different sizes.</p>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>The media query assessment had me mixed on it being difficult and understanding it. When I did the examples on w3schools I understood the concepts and it's use, but I had a little trouble implementing this into my own site. Overall I learned why it's important to add breakpoints and media queries to your website for all devices.</p>
