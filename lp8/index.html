                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The overview of lesson 8 was a reflection of what we learned overall and frameworks.</p><br/>
                <h2>Goals of the assignment</h2>
                <p>The goal of the assignments were to learn about different frame works, make a presentation on assigned frameworks, and implement them.</p>
                <p>I learned </p><br/>
                <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
                <p>I wish I could've done better overall within the last few assignments and doing the group project. I was behind a lot and couldn't keep up so I made a different presentation. I learned many things overall within this class and learned to use many skills to put them into creating my own websites. All the lesson plans really helped further my knowledge with CSS and will help me in the future with future projects.</p><br>
                <p>Once this class is done, my future plan is to learn more about debugging, 2D & 3D animation, media query, flexbox/grid, and CSS scroll snap. These would be my top more to learn about because I had some what of a hard time figuring stuff out.</p>

                    <p>This assignment us focus on a frame work and dive into learning about it more. I learned things such as the uses, pros and cons of each frame work and why its frameworks are important. This presentation includes many things learned from Foundation framework.</p>
