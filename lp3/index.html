             <h1>About learning plan 3</h1> <br/>
               <h2>Overview</h2>
               <p>The overview for learning plan 3 was viewing different CSS layouts and doing practices on them. </p><br/>
               <h2>Goals of the assignment</h2>
                <p>The goal of this assignment was to use practice and view grids vs flexboxes, and the difference between them. This assignment had me do many practices on all CSS styles/properties and had tests at the end of them. The assessment we had to do for learning plan 3 was creating a layout.</p>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Going into this learning plan, I didn't know much about layouts such as grids and flexboxes and their different uses. I found out many new things such as when it's best to use and implement either flexbox or grid layouts.</p>

                    <p>This project had me employ and use many CSS properties to modify my page. Some examples here being back-ground properties, to hoverable pagination, to CSS type effects, etc.</p>
                    <p>I learned many new properties and how to style my pages better. Some new things I learned were color opacity, all types of ordered lists, and many more. </p>
