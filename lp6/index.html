                <h1>About learning plan 6</h1> <br/>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The overview of lesson 6 was learning how to do 2d and 3d transformations using practices given to us.  </p><br/>
                <h2>Goals of the assignment</h2>
                <p>The goal of this assignment was to use both 2d and 3d transformations. I learned how to use and implement 2d and 3d transitions. I learned some new styles and properties such as the rotate methods, translate and skew. The practices had us use those properties in the projects. For the 3d part, I learned how to use methods such as translate, scale, and rotate again.</p><br/>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Learning plan 6 was kind of difficult to do and figure out in the beginning but I understood it more as I kept doing it and using sources. Both 2d and 3d were difficult to learn I think because of the properties. </p>

            <h2>Practices</h2>
                <h2>2D animations</h2>
                <a href="2d_animations/2dx/index.html" target="_blank"><h3>skew X</h3></a>
                <a href="2d_animations/2dy/index.html" target="_blank"><h3>skew Y</h3></a>
                <a href="2d_animations/2dmatrix/index.html" target="_blank"><h3>Matrix</h3></a>
                <a href="2d_animations/rotate/index.html" target="_blank"><h3>rotate</h3></a>
                <p>This assignment had me show many strategies using the many properties 2d animations had. I worked with skew X and Y and also used Matrix and rotation.</p>
                <p></p><br/>
                <h2>3D animations</h2>
                <a href="3d_animations/3dx/index.html" target="_blank"><h3>x-axis</h3></a>
                <a href="3d_animations/3dy/index.html" target="_blank"><h3>y-axis</h3></a>
                <a href="3d_animations/3dz/index.html" target="_blank"><h3>z-axis</h3></a>
                <p>This assignment, I had to use and work with 3D animations. I used properties such as translate and scale to any given "axis" in the examples.</p>
