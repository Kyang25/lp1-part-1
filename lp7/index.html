                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The overview of lesson 7 was learning how to use animations. We had to use a source to start then find another example on our own. </p><br/>
                <h2>Goals of the assignment</h2>
                <p>The goal of this assignments were to show that we could implement the animations in our websites through styling and using keyframes, image gallery, sprites, and more.</p>
                <p>I learned what keyframes were, and how they were able to make the animations they did through styling it.</p><br/>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This assessment and learning plan made sense to me and I understood it pretty well. I understood how the keyframes worked and how you were supposed to apply the required styles for it to show. Though some of the harder parts for me were using sprites and the image gallery samples.
